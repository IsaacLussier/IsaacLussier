# Isaac's README 

Welcome to my GitHub. This semester I am getting myself oriented with GitHub as part of my _Secure Web Apps and Technology_ course at **Western Michigan!**

Once I have the hang of it, I'll be excited to commit projects from this course to my profile as well as some previous projects from both in and out of school.

Some languages I'm familiar with so far:
- C++
- C
- Python
- javascript
- Markdown!

Excited to update my repos as well as this README.
