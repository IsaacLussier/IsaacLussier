# Isaac's README 

Welcome to my GitHub. This semester I am getting myself oriented with GitHub as part of my _Secure Web Apps and Technology_ course at **Western Michigan!**

This semester I would like to learn:
1. How to effectively integrate myself and contribute to secure human-hardware systems
2. How to contribute meaningfully to other people's projects that I'm interested in via Issues and Forks
3. What it takes to be ahead of the curve constantly in the ever-evolving worlds of threats and security as it pertains to systems

Once I have the hang of it, I'll be excited to commit projects from this course to my profile as well as some previous projects from both in and out of school.

Some languages I'm familiar with so far:
- C++
- C
- Python
- javascript
- Markdown!

Excited to update my repos as well as this README in the future. Here's to a good semester!
